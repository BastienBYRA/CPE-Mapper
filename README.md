# CPE-Mapper
CPE-mapper is a CLI tool and JSON-based database designed to accurately map software package names to their corresponding CPEs (Common Platform Enumerations). 

Its main goal is to improve vulnerability identification in cases where standard package names fail to match known CPEs.

# Highlights
- üì¶ Easy to install and easy to use
- ‚ö° Lightweight and fast
- üîí Security-focused with evidence-backed mappings
- üîç Accurate vulnerability mapping through custom CPE associations
- ‚ú® Compatible CycloneDX JSON from 1.2 to 1.6
- üß© Roadmap includes SPDX 2.x, XML support and custom user mappings database
