# CPE-Mapper
CPE-mapper is a CLI tool and JSON-based database designed to accurately map software package names to their corresponding CPEs (Common Platform Enumerations). 

Its main goal is to improve vulnerability identification in cases where standard package names fail to match known CPEs.

# Highlights
- üì¶ Easy to install and easy to use
- ‚ö° Lightweight and fast
- üîí Security-focused with evidence-backed mappings
- üîç Accurate vulnerability mapping through custom CPE associations
- ‚ú® Compatible CycloneDX JSON from 1.2 to 1.6
- üß© Roadmap includes SPDX 2.x, XML support and custom user mappings database

# Getting Started

## Installing
You can install CPE-mapper in several ways:

1. From `npm`.
```bash
npm install -g @bastienbyra/cpe-mapper

# You can then run it using `cpe-mapper`
```

2. Through `Docker image`.
```bash
docker run -v path/to/your/bom/folder:/data --rm ghcr.io/bastienbyra/cpe-mapper:latest apply -i /data/bom.json -o /data/mapped_bom.json
```

## Commands

### Apply
```bash
Usage: cpe-mapper apply [options]

Apply CPE mappings to a CycloneDX BOM file

Options:
  -i, --input-file <file>   Input BOM file (JSON)
  -o, --output-file <file>  Output mapped BOM file
  -u, --update              Update the CPE Mapping database
  --override-cpe            Override BOM CPEs with mapped values from our database
  -v, --verbose             Enable verbose logging
  -h, --help                display help for command
```
#### Example
Apply CPE-mapper database mappings to a BOM file
```bash
cpe-mapper apply -i input-bom.json -o output-bom.json
```

Apply CPE-mapper database mappings to a BOM file, overwriting the existing CPEs in the input file.
```bash
cpe-mapper apply -i input-bom.json -o output-bom.json --override-cpe
```

### Update
```bash
Usage: cpe-mapper update [options]

Update the CPE mappings database

Options:
  -h, --help  display help for command
```

#### Example
Check if the database has updates and apply them.
```bash
cpe-mapper update
```
