Every contribution is valuable and welcome!

## Issues & Implementation Tracking
Use **Issues** to report bugs or to track features that have already been agreed upon.

Please open **one issue per problem or feature** to keep things clear and easy to track.

## Ideas, Features & Questions
Use **Discussions** for suggestions, feature requests, ideas, questions, or general conversations about the project.

Please create **one discussion per topic** to keep things organized.

If a proposal is accepted, it can then be turned into an Issue for implementation.
