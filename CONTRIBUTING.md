Every contribution is valuable and welcome!  

## How to Contribute
If you’d like to contribute, feel free to pick **any task** from the TODO section in the ROADMAP.md, whether it’s *Mandatory* or *Bonus*!  

To get started:  
1. Choose a task from the roadmap.  
2. Open an issue (one per problem or feature) or start working directly.  
3. Submit a Pull Request when ready.

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages.  

We also try to limit external dependencies, so please add them carefully and only if truly required!
